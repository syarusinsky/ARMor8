FLASHING BOTH CORES:
	1. in CM4 directory, openocd -f STM32h745zi_CM4.cfg
	2. in CM7 directory, arm-none-eabi-gdb main_debug.elf
	3. with that gdb, target extended-remote :3333
	4. with that gdb, load
	5. with that gdb, quit
	6. in CM4 directory, arm-none-eabi-gdb main_debug.elf
	7. with that gdb, target extended-remote :3334
	8. with that gdb, load
	9. with that gdb, quit
	10. exit openocd

CORE_M7:
	1. openocd -f STM32h745zi_CM7.cfg
	2. arm-none-eabi-gdb main_debug.elf
	3. target extended-remote :3333
	4. debug as normal

CORE_M4:
	0. run core_m7 as described above, stopping stepping right after clock config
	1. openocd -f STM32h745zi_CM4.cfg
	2. arm-none-eabi-gdb main_debug.elf
	3. target extended-remote :3334
	4. debug as normal

NOTES:
	- Using openocd 1.11
